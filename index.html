            <h2 class="section-title">About No, I'm not a Human</h2>
            <div class="about-content">
                <div class="about-text">
                    <p><strong>No, I'm not a Human</strong> represents a groundbreaking achievement in psychological horror gaming, crafted by the innovative Russian studio Trioskaz and brought to players worldwide through Critical Reflex's publishing expertise. Released on September 15, 2025, this first-person horror visual novel has captivated audiences with its unique blend of atmospheric storytelling and gameplay mechanics that challenge players' perceptions of trust and survival.</p>

                    <h3>The Apocalyptic Setting</h3>
                    <p>Set in a hauntingly plausible near-future scenario, the game world has been devastated by catastrophic solar activity that has transformed daytime into a deadly inferno. The sun's intensified radiation has made outdoor exposure during daylight hours virtually impossible, forcing survivors to adopt a nocturnal existence. Humanity has adapted to this new reality by living indoors during the day, emerging only under the cover of darkness to scavenge for supplies and seek shelter from the relentless solar assault.</p>

                    <p>This dramatic shift in human civilization has created a society operating in reverse—work, travel, and social interaction now occur exclusively during nighttime hours. The psychological toll of this inverted existence weighs heavily on survivors, who must navigate a world turned upside down by environmental catastrophe. The game masterfully portrays the gradual decay of societal structures and the emergence of new survival strategies in this altered reality.</p>

                    <h3>The Visitor Threat</h3>
                    <p>Beneath the surface of this solar apocalypse lurks an even more insidious danger—the emergence of mysterious entities known as "Visitors" from the planet's depths. These beings possess an uncanny ability to mimic human appearance with frightening accuracy, making them nearly indistinguishable from genuine survivors. Their integration into human society represents a biological invasion that preys upon the vulnerabilities of a civilization already struggling for survival.</p>

                    <p>The Visitors' true nature remains shrouded in mystery, but their predatory behavior patterns suggest a calculated infiltration strategy. They understand human social structures and exploit the basic human need for community and shelter during times of crisis. This psychological warfare aspect elevates the game beyond simple horror tropes, creating an experience that questions the very foundations of trust and human connection.</p>

                    <h3>Identification Methods and Challenges</h3>
                    <p>The government response to this crisis has been the establishment of a sophisticated identification system broadcast through emergency channels. Daily transmissions provide survivors with crucial information about Visitor characteristics, including:</p>
                    <div class="visitor-identification">
                        <div class="identification-category">
                            <h4>Physical Indicators</h4>
                            <div class="indicator-list">
                                <div class="indicator-item">• Abnormal dental characteristics: perfectly white, flawless teeth that appear artificial</div>
                                <div class="indicator-item">• Ocular abnormalities: bloodshot eyes with distinctive red streaks or unusual pupil reactions</div>
                                <div class="indicator-item">• Dermatological anomalies: absence of body hair, particularly in underarm regions</div>
                                <div class="indicator-item">• Behavioral irregularities: unnatural stillness, synchronized movements, or atypical social responses</div>
                                <div class="indicator-item">• Physiological inconsistencies: irregular breathing patterns, unusual body temperature regulation</div>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>However, the identification process is complicated by several critical factors. Not all Visitors display the complete range of known characteristics, and some humans may exhibit similar traits due to stress, radiation exposure, or other environmental factors. This ambiguity creates a persistent state of uncertainty that keeps players constantly questioning their judgments and decisions.</p>

                    <h3>Gameplay Mechanics and Strategic Depth</h3>
                    <p>Players assume the role of a lone survivor maintaining vigil from a small house on the town's periphery. The gameplay revolves around the nightly arrival of visitors seeking shelter, each presenting a potential life-or-death decision. Players must carefully manage limited energy resources to conduct thorough examinations, balancing the need for information against the risk of depletion.</p>

                    <p>The game's energy system creates meaningful strategic choices that directly impact survival outcomes. Each examination consumes valuable energy that could be better spent on other survival needs. Players must prioritize which visitors warrant closer inspection and which can be safely accepted or rejected based on initial observations and behavioral analysis.</p>

                    <h3>Moral Complexity and Narrative Branching</h3>
                    <p>What sets "No, I'm not a Human" apart from typical horror games is its nuanced exploration of moral decision-making under extreme pressure. The game doesn't present clear-cut right or wrong choices but rather forces players to navigate a complex ethical landscape where survival instincts conflict with humanitarian values. Each decision carries weight and consequences that ripple through the narrative.</p>

                    <p>The branching story structure ensures that player choices have meaningful impact on the game's progression and ultimate resolution. Multiple endings reflect different approaches to the survival crisis, ranging from optimistic scenarios about human resilience to bleak portrayals of societal collapse. This narrative depth encourages repeated playthroughs to explore different decision paths and discover all possible outcomes.</p>

                    <h3>Atmospheric Design and Psychological Horror</h3>
                    <p>The game's visual and audio design work in concert to create an atmosphere of constant tension and unease. The contrast between the relative safety of night and the terrifying daylight hours establishes a unique rhythm that keeps players perpetually on edge. Environmental storytelling through window views of the collapsing world outside adds layers of contextual depth to the immediate survival challenges.</p>

                    <p>Psychological horror elements are woven throughout the experience, from the unsettling realism of the Visitor mimicry to the gradual erosion of the protagonist's mental stability under the constant pressure of life-or-death decisions. The game explores themes of trust, identity, and the fundamental human need for connection in the face of overwhelming existential threats.</p>
